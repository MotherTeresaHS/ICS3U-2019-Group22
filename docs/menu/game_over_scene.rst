Game Over Scene
===============

To create Egg Collector's final Game Over scene, I displayed the final score of the game at the top of the screen by formatting the score variable into text which I then appended to a list of text which also holds the emboldened words "GAME OVER" and "PRESS SELECT". I then bound the select key of the pybadge to an if statement which returns the user to the main menu scene. For this I used the Score pallette as I prefer it with the blue background of Egg Collector.
