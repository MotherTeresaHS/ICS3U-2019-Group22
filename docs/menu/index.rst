Menu Scene
***********

In Egg Collector the menu scene acts as a preview to the actual game. We see the tree in the background as well as eggs falling just like the actual game. Making this scene was actually quite easy as i just used assets i had previously created in the game scene like the tree and the egg falling loop. Other than reusing those assets I added in text displaying the games name and prompting the user to start and added an if statement in the game loop which called the game scene function if the start button is pressed on the pybadge.
