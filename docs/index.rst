In this project I made an old school style video game for the `Adafruit PyBadge <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200>`_. To recreate it you will need to use an `CircuitPython <https://circuitpython.org>`_ and the `stage library <https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library>`_ to create the game which I called Egg Collector. The game will also work on other variants of PyBadge hardware, like the `PyGamer <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242>`_ and the `EdgeBadge <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400>`_. The full completed game code with all the assets can be found `here <https://github.com/MotherTeresaHS/ICS3U-2019-Group22>`_.

The guide assumes that you have prior coding experience, hopefully in Python. It is designed to use just introductory concepts. No Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are used so that anyone with a basic grade 11 knowledge of python programming can recreate it.

**Parts**

You will need the following items:
